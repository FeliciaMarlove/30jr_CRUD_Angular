# Management application
## Purpose of the app
The application allows users to participate in a "daily challenge". 
Every day, a new task is shown to the user for them to execute. This part of the application is the management interface, which allows to create challenge paths, with a name and description, to add daily challenges to the paths, with a name, summary and description, and to manage all the data (edit, delete...) from a computer with a user-friendly interface.
